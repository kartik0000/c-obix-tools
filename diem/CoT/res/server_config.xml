      - priority: Write priority of the message 
                  ("true" or "false")
      - locale:   Use local settings when printing
                  date and time.

      If the tag presents, than the log file will not be flushed after each 
      message. This tag can be used in order to reduce time required for 
      logging - operating system can buffer messages and write them down to the
      file only when system is not busy. As a drawback, messages can appear in
      the log file with big delay.
