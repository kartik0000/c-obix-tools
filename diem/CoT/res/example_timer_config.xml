		There can be several <connection/> tags, which specify parameters of
		different connections used by oBIX client. Each tag should have
		following obligatory attributes: 
		- 'id':   Unique ID, by which this	connection will be referenced 
		          inside the client. IDs should be consecutive numbers within 
		          range [0 ... (num_of_connections - 1)].
		- 'type': The type of connection. Currently only "http" is supported.
		          It means that client will communicate with server using oBIX 
		          over HTTP requests. Later one more type will be added for 
		          direct communication with oBIX server running on the same 
		          machine.
	-->
	<connection id="0" type="http">
		<!--
			Specifies the address of oBIX server and relative address of the
			Lobby object at this server. Obligatory tag for HTTP connections.
		-->
		<server-address val="http://localhost" lobby="/obix/" />		
		<!--
			Optional tag, specifying period of polling changes from server in
			milliseconds. When using HTTP connection, library creates Watch 
			object on the oBIX server and polls changes from it in order to 
			monitor	subscribed values. Default value is 500 ms.
		-->
		<poll-interval val="1000" />
		<!-- 
			This tag, if presents, says the library to use long poll requests
			instead of classing polling. In long poll mode server holds request
			from client and sends answer only when watching data is updated.
			<long-poll/> has two child tags which define minimum and maximum
			time for which server will wait before sending an answer. 
			
			Note: Long poll request feature is not in oBIX specification and 
			currently available only at C oBIX Server.
			Read more about long polling at the project documentation 
			available online.			
		-->
		<long-poll>
			<!-- 
				Minimum time after which server will reply (even if there is 
				something to send). It is used to reduce network traffic if data
				is changed rapidly.
			-->
			<min-interval val="200" />
			<!--
				Maximum time for which server will wait before answering. If
				watching data is updated during waiting interval, then server 
				will answer immediately, otherwise server will return empty 
				answer after max-interval. 
			-->
			<max-interval val="60000" />
		</long-poll>
		<!--
			Optional tag, specifying Watch.lease time in milliseconds. It 
			defines	for how long a Watch object will be kept on the server if 
			nobody accesses it. If presents than the library tries to set 
			Watch.lease	value after creating Watch object on the oBIX server, 
			but it is not guaranteed that this will make any effect (oBIX 
			servers can prevent	lease time from changing or it can be not 
			implemented at all). If the	tag is not provided than the lease time
			will be calculated as (polling interval + 20 seconds). Obviously, 
			Watch.lease should be longer than <poll-interval/>.
		-->
		<!--watch-lease val="50000" /-->
		<!--
			Optional tag, specifying number of devices which will be registered
			at the oBIX server using this connection. Can be used for better
			memory utilization. Default value is 10.
		-->
		<max-devices val="1" />
		<!--
			Optional tag, specifying maximum number of listener which will be
			registered for each device at the oBIX server using this connection.
			Can be used for better memory utilization. Default value is 10.
		-->
		<max-listeners val="1" />
	</connection>	
	
	<!--
		Optional tag contains SSL setting. Can be used to setup connection to oBIX
		server over HTTPS. 
	 -->
	<ssl>
		<!-- 
			If true, certificate of remote server will be checked to be 
			trusted. If false, no check is done and connection is established in 
			any case. In that case, two other parameters will make no effect. 
		-->
		<verify-peer val="true"/>
		<!-- 
			If true, remote host name will be checked. It should correspond to
			Common Name field of provided certificate. If false, no such check 
			is performed 
		-->
		<verify-host val="true"/>
		<!--
			Following tag can be used to provide custom file with trusted 
			certificates.

	<!--
		Configuration of the logging system. The only obligatory tag is
		<level> which adjusts the amount of output messages.
	-->
	<log>
		<!--
			Defines minimum level of messages which will be printed. Available
			values: 
			- debug: Write to log all possible messages; 
			- warning: Write to log only warnings and errors; 
			- error: Write to log only errors; 
			- no: Do not write any log.
		-->
		<level val="warning" />
		<!--
			Optional tag. If presents, forces to use syslog for logging.
			Otherwise all log messages are printed to console (stdout). This tag
			can have optional attribute 'facility' which specifies facility of
			syslog messages (read more about message facility in syslog
			documentation). 
			Possible values of the 'facility' attribute are: 
			- user: Used for any user applications (default value); 
			- daemon: Used for system daemons; 
			- local0: System defined; 
			- local1: System defined; 
			- local2: System defined; 
			- local3: System defined; 
			- local4: System defined; 
			- local5: System defined; 
			- local6: System defined; 
			- local7: System defined; 
			It can be useful to configure syslog to print server log into a 
			separate file. One way to do so is: 
			- Set in the tag below one of facilities local0 - local7 which is 
			  not used in your system yet. For instance, you chose 'local1' 
			- Go to syslog.conf file (usually it is at /etc/syslog.conf) and add 
			  the following string: 
			   local1.*		-/var/log/obix.log 
			  That will make syslog to write all messages sent from 'local1' to 
			  the file /var/log/obix.log. Symbol '-' before target path means 
			  that file will be written in asynchronous mode, which is quicker 
			  in general, but new messages can appear with delay. 
			- It is also possible to forward error messages to a separate file 
			  like this:
			   local1.err;local1.warning	-/var/log/obix-error.log 
			You can read more about syslog configuration at syslog.conf manual 
			page.
