		There can be several <connection/> tags, which specify parameters of
		different connections used by oBIX client. Each tag should have
		following obligatory attributes: 
		- 'id':   Unique ID, by which this	connection will be referenced 
		          inside the client. IDs should be consecutive numbers within 
		          range [0 ... (num_of_connections - 1)].
		- 'type': The type of connection. Currently only "http" is supported.
		          It means that client will communicate with server using oBIX 
		          over HTTP requests. Later one more type will be added for 
		          direct communication with oBIX server running on the same 
		          machine.
	-->
	<connection id="0" type="http">
		<!--
			Specifies the address of oBIX server and relative address of the
			Lobby object at this server. Obligatory tag for HTTP connections.
		-->
		<server-address val="http://localhost" lobby="/obix/" />
		<!--server-address val="http://andrey-desktop:1234" lobby="/obix" /-->
		<!--
			Optional tag, specifying period of polling changes from server in
			milliseconds. When using HTTP connection library creates Watch object
			on the oBIX server and polls changes from it in order to monitor
			subscribed values. Default value is 500 ms.
		-->
		<poll-interval val="5000" />
		<!--
			Optional tag, specifying Watch.lease time in milliseconds. It defines
			for how long a Watch object will be kept on the server if nobody
			accesses it. If presents than the library tries to set Watch.lease
			value after creating Watch object on the oBIX server, but it is not
			guaranteed that this will make any effect (oBIX servers can prevent
			lease time from changing or it can be not implemented at all). If the
			tag is not provided than the lease time will be calculated as 
			(polling interval + 10 seconds). Obviously, Watch.lease should be 
			longer than <poll-interval/>.
		-->
		<!--watch-lease val="10000" /-->
		<!--
			Optional tag, specifying number of devices which will be registered
			at the oBIX server using this connection. Can be used for better
			memory utilization. Default value is 10.
		-->
		<max-devices val="1" />
		<!--
			Optional tag, specifying maximum number of listener which will be
			registered for each device at the oBIX server using this connection.
			Can be used for better memory utilization. Default value is 10.
		-->
		<max-listeners val="1" />
	</connection>

	<!--
		Configuration of the logging system. The only obligatory tag is
		<level> which adjusts the amount of output messages.
	-->
	<log>
		<!--
			Available values: 
			- debug:   Write to log all possible messages; 
			- warning: Write to log only warnings and errors; 
			- error:   Write to log	only errors; 
			- no:      Do not write any log.
		-->
		<level val="warning" />
		<!--
			The name of the log file. If this tag is omitted than all messages 
			are	forwarded to the standard output (stdout).
		-->
		<!--<file val="obix_client.log" />-->
		<!--
			Format of the log messages. The tag itself and all its attributes are
			optional. In case if some attribute is missing, corresponding option
			is disabled by default. 
			Attributes: 
			- prefix:   Common prefix for each message;
			- date:     Write date of the message ("true" or "false"); 
			- time:     Write time of the message ("true" or "false"); 
			- priority: Write priority of the message ("true" or "false"); 
			- locale:   Use local settings when printing date and time ("true" 
			            or "false").
		-->

		<!--
			If the tag presents, than the log file will not be flushed after each
			message.
