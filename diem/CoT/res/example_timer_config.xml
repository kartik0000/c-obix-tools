		There can be several <connection/> tags, which specify parameters of
		different connections used by oBIX client. Each tag should have
		following obligatory attributes: 
		- 'id':   Unique ID, by which this	connection will be referenced 
		          inside the client. IDs should be consecutive numbers within 
		          range [0 ... (num_of_connections - 1)].
		- 'type': The type of connection. Currently only "http" is supported.
		          It means that client will communicate with server using oBIX 
		          over HTTP requests. Later one more type will be added for 
		          direct communication with oBIX server running on the same 
		          machine.
	-->
	<connection id="0" type="http">
		<!--
			Specifies the address of oBIX server and relative address of the
			Lobby object at this server. Obligatory tag for HTTP connections.
		-->
		<server-address val="http://localhost" lobby="/obix/" />
		<!--server-address val="http://andrey-desktop:1234" lobby="/obix" /-->
		<!--
			Optional tag, specifying period of polling changes from server in
			milliseconds. When using HTTP connection library creates Watch 
			object on the oBIX server and polls changes from it in order to 
			monitor	subscribed values. Default value is 500 ms.
		-->
		<poll-interval val="1000" />
		<!-- 
			This tag, if presents, says the library to use long poll requests
			instead of classing polling. In long poll mode server holds request
			from client and sends answer only when watching data is updated.
			<long-poll/> has two child tags which define minimum and maximum
			time for which server will wait before sending an answer. 
			
			TODO Add reference to long poll description here. 
			Note: Long poll request feature is not in oBIX specification and 
			currently available only at C oBIX Server.			
		-->
		<long-poll>
			<!-- 
				Minimum time after which server will reply (even if there is 
				something to send). It is used to reduce network traffic if data
				is changed rapidly.
			-->
			<min-interval val="200" />
			<!--
				Maximum time for which server will wait before answering. If
				watching data is updated during waiting interval, then server 
				will answer immediately, otherwise server will return empty 
				answer after max-interval. 
			-->
			<max-interval val="60000" />
		</long-poll>
		<!--
			Optional tag, specifying Watch.lease time in milliseconds. It 
			defines	for how long a Watch object will be kept on the server if 
			nobody accesses it. If presents than the library tries to set 
			Watch.lease	value after creating Watch object on the oBIX server, 
			but it is not guaranteed that this will make any effect (oBIX 
			servers can prevent	lease time from changing or it can be not 
			implemented at all). If the	tag is not provided than the lease time
			will be calculated as (polling interval + 20 seconds). Obviously, 
			Watch.lease should be longer than <poll-interval/>.
		-->
		<!--watch-lease val="50000" /-->
		<!--
			Optional tag, specifying number of devices which will be registered
			at the oBIX server using this connection. Can be used for better
			memory utilization. Default value is 10.
		-->
		<max-devices val="1" />
		<!--
			Optional tag, specifying maximum number of listener which will be
			registered for each device at the oBIX server using this connection.
			Can be used for better memory utilization. Default value is 10.
		-->
		<max-listeners val="1" />
	</connection>

	<!--
		Configuration of the logging system. The only obligatory tag is
		<level> which adjusts the amount of output messages.
	-->
	<log>
		<!--
			Log level. Available values: 
			- debug:   Write to log all possible messages; 
			- warning: Write to log only warnings and errors; 
			- error:   Write to log	only errors; 
			- no:      Do not write any log.
		-->
		<level val="warning" />
		<!--
			The name of the log file. If this tag is omitted than all messages 
			are	forwarded to the standard output (stdout).
		-->
		<!--<file val="obix_client.log" />-->
		<!--
			Format of the log messages. The tag itself and all its attributes 
			are	optional. In case if some attribute is missing, corresponding 
			option is disabled by default. 
			Attributes: 
			- prefix:   Common prefix for each message;
			- date:     Write date of the message ("true" or "false"); 
			- time:     Write time of the message ("true" or "false"); 
			- priority: Write priority of the message ("true" or "false"); 
			- locale:   Use local settings when printing date and time ("true" 
			            or "false").
		-->
		<format date="true" time="true" priority="true" locale="true" />		
		<!--
      		If the tag presents, than the log file will not be flushed after 
      		each message. This tag can be used in order to reduce time required 
      		for	logging - operating system can buffer messages and write them 
      		down to the file only when system is not busy. As a drawback, 
      		messages can appear in the log file with big delay.
