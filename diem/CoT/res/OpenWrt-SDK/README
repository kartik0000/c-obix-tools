Makefile from this folder can be used to compile CoT project using OpenWrt SDK.
(http://openwrt.org)
Tested with the following OpenWrt releases:
 - kamikaze 7.09
 - kamikaze 8.09

NOTE:

 I'm not a member of OpenWrt team and most probably know about this platform 
 even less than you. Thus I do not guarantee any quality of the following 
 advises. Use them on your own risk. Still they can be useful, so if you know 
 any better solution, please send it to me. Thanks. 

USAGE:

1. Obtain a working version of OpenWrt SDK

   You can use ready builds from Downloads section of OpenWrt website 
   (e.g. http://downloads.openwrt.org/kamikaze/7.09/brcm47xx-2.6/OpenWrt-SDK-br
   cm47xx-2.6-for-Linux-i686.tar.bz2) or compile it from sources:
   
   - Get sources of required OpenWRT release either from svn or from Downloads
     section of http://openwrt.org.
   - Go to the root source folder and execute 'make menuconfig'
   - If everything is OK configuration menu will appear:
      - Choose required target platform in 'Target System' submenu;
      - In 'Target Images' submenu uncheck all options;
      - Check the 'Build the OpenWrt Image Builder' option;
      - Save and exit menu.
   - Execute 'make V=99' and have some coffee (or lunch) while OpenWrt SDK is
     being built for you.
   - After compilation is completed you will find archive with SDK in ./bin/
     folder.
   - If any problems occur refer to OpenWrt documentation.  
   
2. Prepare Makefile

   - Copy (or create a symlink of) Makefile from this folder to 
     <OpenWrt SDK>/package/cot/
   - Open it in your favorite editor and find definition of Build/Prepare step.
     At this step source of the CoT project is copied to the SDK build folder. 
   - Modify path where CoT sources should be copied from. 
   - ! Check that you don't have any compiled binaries in the folder from which
     sources will be copied (run 'make clean' in the CoT root folder to make 
     sure that nothing is left). 
      
3. Get makefiles for dependency libraries

   CoT depends on the following libraries which are not included to the Open Wrt
   SDK by default: 
   - fcgi
   - libupnp
   - libcurl
   These also require following libraries to be compiled with no problems:
   - openssl
   - uclibc++
   - zlib
   
   One way to include these libs to Open Wrt SDK is to compile them as a 
   separate packages. In order to do so, you'll need to get ready makefiles 
   which will make all magic for you (of course, you are free to compile them by 
   yourself instead). These can be downloaded from openwrt svn:
   
   - If you use old Open Wrt SDK release (<= 8.09) than checkout fcgi, lipupnp, 
     curl and uclibc++ folders from 
     svn://svn.openwrt.org/openwrt/branches/packages_8.09/libs/
     Otherwise use svn://svn.openwrt.org/openwrt/packages/libs/ for latest 
     version of makefiles.
   - Makefiles for two remaining libraries (zlib and openssl) can be found at
     build root in ./package/ folder: 
      svn://svn.openwrt.org/openwrt/tags/<release tag>/package - for old 
                                                                 releases
      svn://svn.openwrt.org/openwrt/package                    - for latest
                                                                 version
   - Save downloaded libraries to <OpenWrt SDK>/package/ folder.
 
4. Time to build

   Now everything should be ready for compilation. Go to <OpenWrt SDK> root 
   folder and execute following command: 'make package/cot-compile V=99'
   Ideally SDK should start from compiling dependency libraries, by downloading
   required sources from Internet and making other intelligent stuff.
   If you are lucky and everything is compiled successfully, than output
   packages will found at <OpenWrt SDK>/bin folder. There will be also packages
   for all dependency libraries but I don't recommend using those. Tt is better
   to download ready packages from OpenWrt website, because I can't guarantee
   that described steps produce truly correct packages.   
   
   In order to recompile CoT use 'make package/cot-clean V=99' first. 
   
5. Compiling own oBIX client applications     

   After successful compilation of CoT packages in OpenWrt SDK it will be 
   possible to compile packages for your own applications which use libcot 
   library. During compilation libcot binaries and headers are installed to 
   <OpenWrt SDK>/staging_dir/<target platform>/usr/lib and
   <OpenWrt SDK>/staging_dir/<target platform>/usr/include/cot respectively. 
   They can be also automatically located by configure script 
   (e.g. using AC_SEARCH_LIBS).
