This folder contains scripts which can be used to compile CoT project using 
OpenWrt SDK (http://openwrt.org).

Tested with the following OpenWrt releases:
 - kamikaze 7.09
 - kamikaze 8.09

NOTE:

 I'm not a member of OpenWrt team and most probably know about this platform 
 even less than you. Thus I do not guarantee any quality of the following 
 advises. Use them on your own risk. Still they can be helpful, so if you know 
 any better solution, please send it to me. Thanks. 

USAGE:

1. Obtain a working version of OpenWrt SDK

   You can use ready builds from Downloads section of OpenWrt website 
   (e.g. http://downloads.openwrt.org/kamikaze/7.09/brcm47xx-2.6/OpenWrt-SDK-br
   cm47xx-2.6-for-Linux-i686.tar.bz2) or compile it from sources:
   
   - Get sources of required OpenWRT release either from svn or from Downloads
     section of http://openwrt.org.
   - Go to the root source folder and execute 'make menuconfig'
   - If everything is OK configuration menu will appear:
      - Choose required target platform in 'Target System' submenu;
      - In 'Target Images' submenu uncheck all options;
      - Check the 'Build the OpenWrt Image Builder' option;
      - Save and exit menu.
   - Execute 'make V=99' and have some coffee (or lunch) while OpenWrt SDK is
     being built for you.
   - After compilation is completed you will find archive with SDK in ./bin/
     folder.
   - If any problems occur refer to the OpenWrt documentation.  
   
2. Prepare Makefile

   - Copy the ./cot folder from here (with Makefile in it) to 
     <OpenWrt SDK>/package/cot/
   - The Makefile you've just copied says to Open Wrt SDK that it should 
     download distribution of the project from the Internet. If you don't want
     SDK to do it (or URL form Makefile is not available, which is quite 
     possible) than just put the tarball (.tar.bz2 archive of the project) to 
     the Open Wrt SDK download folder (usually it is <OpenWrt SDK>/dl/).
      
3. Get makefiles for dependency libraries

   CoT depends on the following libraries which are not included to the Open Wrt
   SDK by default:   
   - libfcgi
   - libupnp
   - libcurl
   These also require following additional libraries to be compiled:
   - openssl
   - uclibc++
   - zlib
   
   One way to include these libs to Open Wrt SDK is to compile them as a 
   separate packages. In order to do so, you'll need to get ready makefiles 
   which will make all magic for you (of course, you are free to compile them by 
   yourself instead). Makefiles for these libraries (as well as some patch 
   files) can be downloaded from the OpenWrt SVN repository:
   
   - If you use old Open Wrt SDK release (<= 8.09) than checkout fcgi, libupnp, 
     curl and uclibc++ folders from 
     svn://svn.openwrt.org/openwrt/branches/packages_8.09/libs/
     Otherwise use svn://svn.openwrt.org/openwrt/packages/libs/ for latest 
     version of makefiles.
   - Makefiles for two remaining libraries (zlib and openssl) can be found at
     build root in ./package/ folder: 
      svn://svn.openwrt.org/openwrt/tags/<release tag>/package - for old 
                                                                 releases
      svn://svn.openwrt.org/openwrt/package                    - for latest
                                                                 version
   - Save downloaded folders to <OpenWrt SDK>/package/ folder.
 
4. Time to build

   Now everything should be ready for compilation. Go to <OpenWrt SDK> root 
   folder and execute following command: 'make package/cot-compile V=99'
   Ideally SDK should start from compiling dependency libraries, by downloading
   required sources from Internet and making other intelligent stuff.
   If you are lucky and everything is compiled successfully, than output
   packages will found at <OpenWrt SDK>/bin folder. You'll need the following 
   packages from here:   
   - libcot_<version>.ipk			Common library for oBIX clients and server;
   - cot-server_<version>.ipk		oBIX server;
   - cot-adapters_<version>.ipk		oBIX adapters.
   
   There will be also packages for all dependency libraries but I don't 
   recommend using those. It is better to download ready packages from OpenWrt 
   website if possible, because I can't guarantee that described steps produce 
   truly correct packages.   
   
   In order to recompile CoT use 'make package/cot-clean V=99' first. Command
   'make clean V=99' will remove everything including compilation outputs of all
   dependency libraries. Note, that in case if you want OpenWrt SDK to download 
   a new version of CoT from Internet, you will need to delete cached CoT 
   tarball from <OpenWrt SDK>/dl folder. Otherwise SDK will use this cached 
   archive and you will receive the same version compiled. 
   
5. Compiling own oBIX client applications     

   After successful compilation of CoT packages it will be possible to compile 
   packages for your own applications which use libcot library using the same
   OpenWrt SDK. libcot binaries and headers are installed during compilation to 
   <OpenWrt SDK>/staging_dir/<target platform>/usr/lib and
   <OpenWrt SDK>/staging_dir/<target platform>/usr/include/cot respectively.    
   They can be also automatically located by configure script of your project 
   (e.g. using AC_SEARCH_LIBS).
