=====

 --3-- Building instructions
 
 Please refer res/OpenWrt-SDK/README if you want to compile the project for 
 OpenWrt platform.
  
 Simple compilation can be done by executing following commands in the project 
 root folder (for advanced instructions read /INSTALL):
 
 Before the first compilation:
 
 ./configure		That will configure building system according to your system 
 					configuration. 					  					
 					
 You would probably like to use also following flags:
   
  CFLAGS="-O0 -g"	Forces to produce binaries which are easier to debug.
  
  --prefix="<path>" Sets the installation root folder. By default, package is
  					installed to /usr/{bin,lib,include}.
 
 You will need the following libraries to build CoT (configure script should 
 tell you which are missing):
 - lwl (Log Writer Library http://gna.org/projects/lwl/)
 - fcgi
 - libupnp
 - libcurl  					
  					
 After ./configure is successfully completed execute:
 
 make all			That would compile the project. All binaries will be placed 
 					in the same folders with source files. 
 
 make install		Will put binaries, config files and documentation to the 
 					installation directories.

 --4-- Configuring oBIX server
 
 oBIX server is implemented as FastCGI script which can be executed by any HTTP
 server with FCGI support. This section describes how to configure lighttpd to 
 run oBIX server. For other HTTP server most of steps would be probably the 
 same.
 
 1. Install lighttpd at your target system.
 2. Open res/server_config.xml with your favorite XML editor.
 3. All configuration tags are well described there: Read description carefully,
    modify and save options according to your needs.    
 4. Open res/obix-lighttpd.conf file with your favorite editor.
 5. Modify paths in the following variables:
 	- "socket"  		Defines socket name which will be used for communication 
 						between lighttpd and oBIX server.
 	- "bin-path"		Command which starts up the oBIX server, which is 
 						"<path-to-obix.fcgi> <path-to-folder-with-conf-files>"
 	- "bin-environment"	This variable can be totally omitted, or used, for 
 						instance, for specifying the path to shared libraries.
 	In order to check whether the launch command is correct you can try to 
 	execute it from command line. If everything is fine, that oBIX server should
 	start up and then immediately shutdown gracefully because of no fcgi 
 	connection.								 		 
 6. Locate your lighttpd configuration file. Usually it is at /etc/lighttpd/
 7. In case if you have etc/lighttpd/conf-available/ folder than you are lucky
 	and should should proceed with steps a. otherwise, go to steps b.
 	
 	a. Go to conf-available/ folder and create symlink '10-obix-fcgi.conf' to
 	   the updated res/obix-lighttpd.conf file. 
 	   Execute command '/usr/sbin/lighty-enable-mod obix-fcgi' and restart 
 	   lighttpd.
 	   (Read conf-available/README in order to get more details about what you
 	   have done.)
 	   
 	b. In case you do not have described folder for lighttpd in your target 
 	   platform, than open main lighttpd configuration file (usually 
 	   /etc/lighttpd/lighttpd.conf) and paste to the end the contents of updated 
 	   res/obix-lighttpd.conf file.
 	   Note that "server.modules" are usually defined in the beginning of the
 	   conf file, so check that pasted string is not conflicting with the 
 	   original definition.
 	   Save configuration and restart lighttpd.
 8. If everything is OK, than you will be able to access oBIX server from your
    browser under the following link: http://<you server address>/obix/
    In case of any problems try to check lighttpd and oBIX server error log 
    files. If it doesn't help than contact me, and I'll try to make better
    version of these instructions.
